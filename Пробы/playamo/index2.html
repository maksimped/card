                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Paintball is a skirmish sport in which players compete to eliminate opponents by tagging them with
                    capsules containing water soluble dye propelled from paintball guns. It is a team game that can be
                    played indoor or outdoor in fields or woods. It was conceived in 1981 in the United States</p>
                <p> The required equipment include Paintball mask, paintball marker, paint grenades, compressed air or
                    CO2 container, paintballs and hopper. Body armor is optional but players should wear it while gaming
                    outside in woods for safety reasons. </p>

                <p> In paintball, players of both teams need to eliminate each other by tagging them with the capsules
                    (paintballs) containing non-toxic and biodegradable water-soluble dye and featuring a gelatin outer
                    shell. These capsules are fired from the paintball marker/gun to hit the target. </p>

                <p>It’s a regularly played game on the sporting level just like other organized competitions are
                    executed with professional teams and players. As the game type varies so is the time of playing that
                    may range from seconds to hours. It may prolong for days in the scenario play..</p>

                <p>Different types of games are played with paintball including flag capturing, opponents’ elimination,
                    ammunition limits, capturing the objects of interest concealed in the playing area and
                    defending/attacking a specific point or area.

                    Woodsball, MilSim (Military Simulation) and Speedball are the most commonly played paintball games
                    in which players must wear protective masks.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Paintball is a sport played by people from all professions and lifestyles. It is a sport where women
                    and men compete equally, and where age is not dominated by youth. Like a game of chess, being able
                    to think quickly and decisively is what makes you a star in paintball. Intelligence and
                    determination, not merely strength, speed or agility, are key to success in the sport.

                    Paintball is a character-building sport. Players learn about teamwork, gain self-confidence and
                    develop leadership abilities while having fun and getting welcome stress-relief. Increasingly,
                    corporations are finding the benefits of having their staff and management participate in paintball
                    games.

                    Paintball is an exciting sport, and above all paintball is fun! It's a chance to shake off your
                    day-to-day responsibilities and rekindle your spirit of adventure. When the adrenaline starts
                    pumping, you can't help but love the thrill of the game!</p>

                <p>For safety, paintball players always must wear goggles specifically designed for paintball to protect
                    their eyes. Goggles must be worn during a game and at all times when a person is in an area where
                    shooting is permitted, such as the target range or chronograph area. A protective facemask is
                    mandatory nearly everywhere, and should be worn regardless. Paintball is a very safe sport as long
                    as safety rules are followed. Insurance statistics have shown that paintball is safer than golf,
                    jogging, tennis, swimming and many other sports.

                    Referees on the field enforce safety and game rules. No physical contact is permitted in the game,
                    and players are ejected from games or the playsite for breaking safety or playing rules. Fields have
                    boundaries, and a player who steps outside a field's boundary is eliminated from that game.</p>
                <p>A paintball is a round, thin-skinned gelatin capsule with colored liquid inside it. Paintballs are
                    similar to large round vitamin capsules or bath oil beads. The fill inside paintballs is non-toxic,
                    non-caustic, water-soluable and biodegradable. It rinses out of clothing and off skin with mild soap
                    and water.

                    Paintballs come in a rainbow of bright colors: blue, pink, white, orange, yellow and more. When a
                    paintball tags a player, the thin gelatin skin splits open, and the liquid inside leaves a bright
                    "paint" mark. A player who is marked is eliminated from the game.</p>
